// Before pool.ts, pollOnce ran every ready issue's whole five-stage chain
// serially — issue #4 never started until #1 finished (audit finding #2).
// These tests assert the two properties that matter: work actually overlaps
// (bounded concurrency, not one-at-a-time) and every item runs exactly once
// (no double-dispatch, even when concurrency exceeds the item count).
