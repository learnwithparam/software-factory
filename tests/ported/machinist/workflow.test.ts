// Ported from owainlewis/machinist@3943516 internal/runner/workflow_test.go:12-40 (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 Owain Lewis). Deviations: the shell-script agent is replaced by the artifact file it would have written; "nonzero overrides result" is a runner rule and is asserted in tests/scenarios.test.ts (14c); the 16 KiB and one-object rules from protocol/workflow.go are added here.
