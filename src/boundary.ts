// Defense in depth behind guard-paths.sh (the PreToolUse hook): that hook
// only sees Edit/Write tool calls, so `Bash("cat > src/auth/x.ts")`, `bun -e`
// or `sed -i` all bypass it (audit finding #12). Before any push, the runner
// independently diffs the branch against its base and refuses to ship if a
// protected path was touched by any means.

// Hardcoded regardless of repo config, mirroring guard-paths.sh's own
// unconditional additions (template/.claude/hooks/guard-paths.sh): a normal
// build must never touch the factory's own state or skills, even with the
// default empty protectedPaths. `factory learn`'s branch never calls this
// check (it uses outsideAllowedPaths instead), so its exemption never
// weakens this for a normal build.
