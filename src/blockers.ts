// The dependency gate: an issue body's "Blocked by: #N, #M" line (or
// "Blocked by: none") says which issues must be closed-completed before this
// one may be picked up. Nothing else in this repo parses that line — tests
// live in tests/blockers.test.ts.
//
// pollOnce (watch.ts) calls resolveBlockers once per poll: it moves a
// LABEL.ready issue with an open blocker to LABEL.blocked (commenting once,
// on that transition only), and promotes a LABEL.blocked issue back to
// LABEL.ready the poll its last blocker clears. Nothing here talks to a
// worktree or a stage; it only reads issue state and swaps a label.
