# Third-party notices

Code ported from other projects. Each ported file starts with a `Ported from` header naming the
upstream repo, commit, path and lines; `tests/provenance.test.ts` keeps this file and those headers
in step. Only MIT and Apache-2.0 code is copied; mastra's `ee/` directories are never read or copied.
